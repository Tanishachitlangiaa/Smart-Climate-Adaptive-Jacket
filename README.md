🧥 CLIMASHIELD 3D

CLIMASHIELD 3D is an interactive Three.js prototype of a smart, climate-adaptive jacket. It features a wearable UI and a responsive LED weather-alert collar. Toggle between Standard, Wind, Storm, and Fog modes to visualize dynamic material and lighting changes. Built for tactical and extreme environment tech concepts.

✨ Features

Interactive 3D Prototype: Fully rendered 3D garment that responds to mouse and touch interactions (click and drag to rotate).

Dynamic Weather Modes:

🟦 Standard: Neutral beige with normal insulation and a subtle blue status collar.

🟨 Wind Alert: Tan fabric transition with an amber warning light.

🟥 Storm Warning: Dark red hue with a bright red flashing/pulsing alert for high visibility.

🟦 Fog Beacon: Maximum visibility blue-grey tone with a high-intensity blue light.

Responsive Wearable UI: A sleek, glassmorphism-inspired overlay that displays real-time system status and temperature control data.

Real-Time Rendering: Utilizes physically based materials and dynamic lighting adjustments.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Three.js: Core 3D rendering engine.

HTML5 & CSS3: Structure and styling.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework used via CDN for rapid UI development.

🚀 Getting Started

This project is entirely front-end and requires no build tools or package managers to run.

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/climashield-3d.git](https://github.com/yourusername/climashield-3d.git)


Navigate to the directory:

cd climashield-3d

Run the application:
Simply open the climashield_prototype.html file in any modern web browser.
(Tip: For the best experience, use a local server like VS Code's "Live Server" extension to avoid strict MIME type issues, though it should run fine as a raw file).

🎮 Usage

Rotate Model: Click and drag (or swipe on touch devices) to rotate the jacket and view it from different angles.

Switch Modes: Click the color-coded buttons at the bottom of the screen to trigger the different weather simulation states. Watch the jacket's material and the collar's LED system adapt instantly.

🔮 Future Scope

Integration with live Weather APIs for real-time localized adaptation.

GPS-based alerts for Merchant Navy and tactical officers.

More complex 3D animations (e.g., physical vent openings, collar adjustments).
